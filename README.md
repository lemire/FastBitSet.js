# FastBitSet.js : a speed-optimized BitSet implementation


A BitSet  (also called Bitmap or bit vector) is an ideal data structure to implement a
set when values being stored are reasonably small integers. It can be orders of magnitude
faster than a generic set implementation. In particular, a BitSet has fast support for set
operations (union, difference, intersection).

The FastBitSet.js implementation optimizes for speed. It can be several times faster than competitive alternatives. It is also entirely
dynamic, and has functions to minimize the memory usage. It should be supported by most of the modern
browsers and JavaScript engines.  It is ideal for maintaining sets of integers when performance matters.


Note that the nearly equivalent [TypedFastBitSet](https://github.com/lemire/TypedFastBitSet.js) library should use less memory in practice and should be prefered is memory usage is a concern. For high-performance and low-memory usage, consider the even better [roaring](https://www.npmjs.com/package/roaring) library: it should surpass both FastBitSet and TypedFastBitSet for a wide range of tasks.

Usage
===

```javascript
const b = new FastBitSet();// initially empty
b.add(1);// add the value "1"
b.has(1); // check that the value is present! (will return true)
b.add(2);
console.log(""+b);// should display {1,2}
b.add(10);
b.array(); // would return [1,2,10]
let c = new FastBitSet([1,2,3,10]); // create bitset initialized with values 1,2,3,10
c.difference(b); // from c, remove elements that are in b (modifies c)
c.difference2(b) // from c, remove elements that are in b (modifies b)
c.change(b); // c will contain all elements that are in b or in c, but not both (elements that changed)
const su = c.union_size(b);// compute the size of the union (bitsets are unchanged)
c.union(b); // c will contain all elements that are in c and b
const out1 = c.new_union(b); // creates a new bitmap that contains everything in c and b
const out2 = c.new_intersection(b); // creates a new bitmap that contains everything that is in both c and b
const out3 = c.new_change(b); // creates a new bitmap that contains everything in b or in c, but not both
const s1 = c.intersection_size(b);// compute the size of the intersection (bitsets are unchanged)
const s2 = c.difference_size(b);// compute the size of the difference (bitsets are unchanged)
const s3 = c.change_size(b); // compute the number of elements that are in b but not c, or vice versa
c.intersects(b); // return true if c intersects with b
c.intersection(b); // c will only contain elements that are in both c and b
c = b.clone(); // create a (deep) copy of b and assign it to c.
c.equals(b); // checks whether c and b are equal
c.forEach(fnc); // execute fnc on each value stored in c
for (const x of c) fnc(x); // execute fnc on each value stored in c (allows early exit with break)
c.trim(); // reduce the memory usage of the bitmap if possible, the content remains the same
```

If you are using node.js, you need to import the module:

```javascript
var FastBitSet = require("fastbitset");
var b = new FastBitSet();// initially empty
b.add(1);// add the value "1"
```


Performance tip: in-place functions such as intersection, union and difference can be
much faster than functions generating a new bitmap (new_intersection, new_union
and new_difference) because they avoid creating a new object, a potentially
expensive process in JavaScript. For faster code, use as few FastBitSet objects as
you can.



npm install
===

      $ npm install fastbitset

Testing
===

Using node.js (npm), you can test the code as follows...

      $ npm install mocha
      $ npm test



Is it faster?
===

It can be quite fast compared to competitive alternatives :

```bash
$ node test.js
